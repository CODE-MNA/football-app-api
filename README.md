# Mini-Football App API


## Overview
A simple extensible JSON API developed using TypeScript, NodeJS (Express). Utilized multiple libraries to implement features such as image uploading. Dockerized application for easy deployment. 


### ðŸ”¥ Features 
 - Register a new player by specifying role, image and name.
 - Return a list of players.
 - Get details about a player.

### âŒš Planned Features
- <b>Implement database storage to introduce data durability.
- Register a team.
- Manage players in the team.
- Alter formation for a team and assign players in slots based on their role.
- Return information about the formation of the team



## Env Variables

```PORT -> Controls the port on which the server listens```

```NODE_ENV -> development | production```

```DELETE_UPLOADS -> set true if you want to delete uploaded files from localsystem when app closes```

## Schema for API 

### <b><span style="color:#f64">POST</span> /players  
 Content-Type : multipart/form-data


Request Body:

- displayName (string): `The display name of the player.`
- position (string): `The position of the player. Allowed values are "Goalkeeper", "Defender", "Mid-Fielder | MidFielder" or "Striker".`
- profileImg (Image File Binary): `The profile image of the player.`

Example Request Body:

```json
{
    "displayName": "John Doe",
    "position": "Mid-Fielder",

    "profileImg": 'BINARY'
}
```

RESPONSE:

```json
{
    "message": "Added new player with id: 1",
   
}
```

}

    {
    "id" : 3,
    "displayName": "John Doe",
    "position": "Striker",

    "profileImg": "www.Link/To/Image.png"
},
{
    "id" : 4,
    "displayName": "Man Sullivan",
    "position": "Defender",

    "profileImg": "www.Link/To/Image2.png"
}
]

### Docker Deployment

- If you have docker installed on your machine,
try running these commands to deploy and run.
    - ```"docker build . -t football-backend:0.0.1 "```
    - ```"docker run -h football-backend --name football-backend -p 3004:3004 -v usr/src/app/uploaded -e NODE_ENV='development' football-backend:0.0.1"```

- Alternatively if you have npm and node, run npm start for the server to start (keep in mind some server shutdown functionality like photos deletion won't work as the node process won't receive the program exit signal when using an npm script!)

### ðŸ›’ Improvements after application becomes more complex
- Using dedicated controller classes for endpoints and passing in interfaces in their constructors that they can call internally.
- Writing tests for the services, endpoints and utility functions.
- Changing image upload storage location from filesystem to an external blob storage resulting in more scalability as the webserver will be stateless and multiple instances can use access the external blob storage. 

<b>WIP : This application can evolve as an app that manages players and teams for a football game / football app. At the moment there is no database and the information that is registered is stored in memory.
